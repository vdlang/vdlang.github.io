<h1>Visually Descriptive Language</h1>



<h2>Definition and Guidelines</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W15-2805">Gaizauskas et al. (2015)</a>, we proposed a definition of Visually Descriptive Language. Intuitively, a segment of text is visually descriptive if we can determine what it says is true or false by visual sense alone.</p>

<p>More precisely, a text segment is visually descriptive iff it asserts one or more propositions about either (a) a specific scene or entity whose truth can be confirmed or disconfirmed through direct visual perception, or (b) a class of scenes or entities whose truth with respect to any instance of the class of scenes or entities can be confirmed or disconfirmed through direct visual perception.</p>

<p>The guidelines are currently available <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/visuallydescriptivelanguage/">here</a>.</p>


<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Our annotated corpus of Visually Descriptive Language is available <a href="downloads/vdl_release_R20190521.zip">here</a>. The corpus is described in <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W15-2805">Gaizauskas et al. (2015)</a>, and has been extended in <a href="http://www.josiahwang.com/publications/isa19.pdf">Alrashid et al. (2019)</a> to cover six additional chapters from the Wonderful Wizard of Oz.</p>
